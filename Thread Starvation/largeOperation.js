// Now we have an event that can be raised from the Node.js event loop (setTimeout) and a function that can keep 
// the JavaScript thread busy (fibonacci). We can now demonstrate starvation in Node.js. Let’s set up a time-out to 
// execute. But before this time-out completes, we execute a function that takes a lot of CPU time and therefore holds up 
// the CPU and the JavaScript thread. As this function is holding on to the JavaScript thread, the event loop cannot call 
// anything else and therefore the time-out is delayed, as demonstrated in starveit.js
