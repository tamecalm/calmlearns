 /*
Because of closures, we have access to the correct user request after the long-running operation 
completes. 
We just handled two requests on a single thread without breaking a sweat. 
Now you should understand the following statement: 
“Node.js is highly performant, and it uses JavaScript because JavaScript supports first-class functions and closures.”


The immediate question that should come to mind when someone tells you that you only have a single thread 
to handle requests is, “But my computer has a quad core CPU. Using only a single thread will surely waste resources.” 
And the answer is that yes it will. However, there is a well-supported way around it that we will examine 
when discussing deployment and scalability. 
Just a quick tip about what you will see there: It is actually really simple 
to use all the CPU cores with a separate JavaScript process for each CPU core using Node.js.
It is also important to note that there are threads managed by Node.js at the C level (such as for certain file 
system operations), but all the JavaScript executes in a single thread. This gives you the performance advantage of the 
JavaScript almost completely owning at least one thread.
