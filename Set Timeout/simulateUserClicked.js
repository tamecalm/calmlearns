// There is a single execution thread in JavaScript. 
// This is the way web browsers have traditionally worked. 
// If you have a long-running operation (such as waiting for a timer to complete or a database query to return), 
// you must continue operation using a callback

function longRunningOperation(callback) {
  // simulate a 3 second operation
  setTimeout(callback, 3000);
 }
  
 function userClicked() {
  console.log('starting a long operation');
  longRunningOperation(function () {
  console.log('ending a long operation');
  });
 }
 // simulate a user action
 userClicked();

 // This simulation is possible in JavaScript because 
 // we have first-class functions and passing functionsâ€”a callback is
 // a well-supported pattern in the language. 
 // Things become interesting when you combine first-class functions with the concept of closures. 
 // Let us image that we are handling a web request and we have a long-running operation such 
 // as a database query that we need to do. A simulated version is shown in simulateWebRequest.js
