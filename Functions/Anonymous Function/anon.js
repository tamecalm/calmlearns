// A function without a name is called an anonymous function. 
// In JavaScript, you can assign a function to a variable. 
// If you are going to use a function as a variable, you donâ€™t need to name the function. 
// In anon.js demonstrates two ways of defining a function inline. 
// Both of these methods are equivalent.

 var calm1 = function namedFunction() {
  console.log('calm1656')
 }
 calm1(); 

 var calm2 = function namedFunction() {
  console.log('calm65562');
 }
 calm2();

 // A programming language is said to have first-class functions. 
 // if a function can be treated the same way as any other variable in the language. 
 // JavaScript has first-class functions.
